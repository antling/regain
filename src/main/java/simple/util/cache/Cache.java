 * This is a LRU, Least Recently Used, <code>Cache</code> used to store
 * objects. This ensures that the <code>Cache</code> does not allow

 * other than the number of lockable regions, i.e. synchronized Least 
 * Recently Used lists, and the maximum number of items a region can 
 * have before it removes the least recently used objects. 
 * <p>
 * When objects are cached they can be cached for a specified number of
 * miliseconds, when this expires then the <code>Cache</code> removes the 
 * item, this removal is very accurate to the timeout specified for the
 * object. If no time out is given a default timeout for this is used. 
 * The maximum capacity of the <code>Cache</code> is regions * limit, 
 * however this does not provide an exact Least Recently Used semantic
 * as some regions are likely to have more hits than others.
